# Text files don't have a specific signature, but we can detect them
# by checking for common text patterns and printable ASCII content
signatures:
  # Common text file indicators (these are heuristic)
  # Note: Text detection is typically done via content analysis
  # rather than magic bytes, so this format has low confidence weight

# Text files are detected primarily through statistical analysis:
# - High ratio of printable ASCII characters (0x20-0x7E)
# - Presence of common whitespace (space, tab, newline)
# - Absence of null bytes or excessive control characters
# - Valid UTF-8 sequences if non-ASCII
